## Wheat Seed Classification and Clustering

This project demonstrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques applied to a dataset of wheat seed characteristics. Using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for classification and K-Means clustering, we explore different approaches to analyze and group the data based on its features.

**Project Highlights**
-**Dataset:** Wheat seed dataset with various features such as area, perimeter, compactness, kernel length, and more.
-**Classification:** Implemented k-NN classification with different values of 
ùëò

k to identify the optimal number of neighbors for accurate predictions.
-**Clustering:** Applied K-Means clustering and evaluated performance using silhouette scores and distortion metrics to determine the optimal number of clusters.
-**Visualization:**  Plots for accuracy as a function of k, silhouette scores, and clustering visualizations help analyze model performance.
-**Files**
**Wheat_Seeds_KNN_and_Clustering_Final.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook with all code, including data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
**seeds_dataset.txt:** Raw dataset file containing wheat seed measurements and class labels.
